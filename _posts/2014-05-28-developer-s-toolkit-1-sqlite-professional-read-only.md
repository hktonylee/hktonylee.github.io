SQLite is widely used in mobile platforms and backend development. It is so commonly used because:

* It is free!
* It is light-weight. You are not required to run giant database service in the background.
* It is easy to backup, reconstruct and transmit the database. This is crucial for developer. You can just duplicate the database file to preserve everything.

SQLite has a command line utility. It is good to use, but not easy to use. For example, the `select` result is quite awful.

Now SQLite Professional comes to the earth and save us.

It is a Mac OS X app. Similar to any database management app, it provides schema view and data view. They are carefully designed and can boost the productivity in no time.
