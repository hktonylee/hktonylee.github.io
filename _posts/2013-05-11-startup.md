Startup, a word that has two meanings here.

The first meaning is about this newly established blog. I would like to write some tehcnical articles in deep. Compared to my another blog ("log" to be accurate), this site focuses more on my inner thoughts. I hope this post is a good start.

Another meaning to "startup" is about my work. I have been working in a startup for almost 3 years. Many things happened and changed my attitude. I will try to make some notes to make them long-lasting. You know, memory is always unreliable (especially my memory LOL).
