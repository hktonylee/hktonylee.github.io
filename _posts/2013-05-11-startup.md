Startup, a word that has two meanings here.

The first meaning is about this newly established blog. I would like to write some articles, richer and deeper. You probably know that I have a daily-like log (not blog). Then I can observe myself by what I have done, rather than why I have done. However, this does not make me a better man if I do not examine myself inside out. So I make this blog separated from the old one. I will focus on writing some of my internal thoughts, as well as some technologies (my love ;D). I hope this post is a good start.

Another meaning to "startup" is about my work. I have been working in a startup for almost 3 years. Many things happened and changed my attitude. I will try to make some notes to make them long-lasting. You know, memory is always unreliable (especially my memory haha).
